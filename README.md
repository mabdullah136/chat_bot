# ChatBot
ChatBot is a Django-based web application that enables users to interact with an AI chatbot powered by the OpenAI API. Users can submit prompts, receive AI-generated responses, and view up to 5 previous chat interactions stored in the session. The chatbot is configurable, allowing you to specify the OpenAI model and max tokens, with a default model of o3-mini.
